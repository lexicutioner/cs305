Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial company that wants to be able to provide individual savings plans, retirement plans, investment plans, and insurance plans. We had to make sure that we followed governmental policy as well as provided secure communications in order to protect sensitive information.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I think I did a good job breaking down the vulnerabilities one by one. Honestly, theres a lot of abstract thinking that comes into the security side of things and I struggled a bit at first in understanding them but it all came full circle.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I thought it was challenging to get the maven dependency check to work, mostly because my eclipse was having issues and required me to resest a bunch of times.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I did a lot of seacrhing through stack overflow to make sure that I was doing things properly.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

All I had to do was run the maven dependency check again in order to see if I still had the same vulnerabilities or if I had fixed what was wrong. I also made sure my code was ruynning functionally by checking the console. I could've also done junit testing if I wanted to up the security even more.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Definitely stack overflow for 1, I would also recommend watching some of the informative youtube videos that are out there on maven dependency checks.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would want to showcase my ability to run a maven dependency chcek in the first place. It is a hard thing to do if eclipse isnt set up properly, and I do think its a big deal that I can do it because I know other programmers who couldn't.
